# Spring Boot Concepts – Clean & Practical Guide

This repository is created to **showcase Spring Boot fundamentals clearly**, using **small, focused, single-file examples** instead of large projects.

The goal is simple:

> One concept → One folder → One Java file → Clear explanation

This makes it easy for **students, interviewers, and recruiters** to understand each concept without digging into a full project.
