# Spring Boot Projects – Real World Applications

This repository contains **complete Spring Boot projects** that demonstrate how different concepts come together to build **real-world backend applications**.

Unlike concept-only examples, these projects focus on:

* Application flow
* Project structure
* REST API design
* End-to-end functionality

> This repository complements the **spring-boot-concepts** repo, which focuses on individual concepts.

---

## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

The main goals of this repository are:

* To showcase **practical implementation** of Spring Boot
* To demonstrate **CRUD operations in real applications**
* To show **project-level understanding**, not just annotations
* To help learners understand how concepts work together
